# Homework 3

## Overview

On knuth (and many other machines), if you accidentally type `sl` instead of `ls`, you will get a big surprise!
Try it out for yourself and see what happens.
This combination of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) art and animation is known as ASCIImation.

Over the next two assignments, youâ€™ll have a chance to implement a system for showing ASCIImation and you'll design your own ASCIImation creation.

In this first half of the assignment, you will also create a Makefile, which will make compiling larger programs (made up of more files) much easier. 

## Reading

We suggest focusing specifically on the following sections of the *C++ Primer* textbook this week:
* Sections 3.5.1-3.5.2 for a review of primitive arrays
* Section 7.1.2 for different ways to define member functions
* Section 8.2 to better understand the file-reading code in the starter code

You should also keep an eye on the [Homework 3 clarifications](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/HW03-Clarifications) wiki page, where we will collectively accumulate clarifications and useful advice for the assignment. You should definitely check this before you start the assignment, and may want to check back periodically (especially if you're having trouble with something in the assignment).
